Funkin.js mods for newgrounds releases of Friday Night Funkin'

## How do I use these mods?
Open Inspect Element and go into "Sources". If you are on newgrounds.com, you have to go down in the Sources menu and find "uploads.ungrounded.net". Open everything inside it until you find the "assets" folder. Right click the "?ngio_session_id=" file and click "Open in new tab".

Copy the contents of the modded JS file, double click the "Funkin.js" file in the uploads.ungrounded.net version and press CTRL+A and then CTRL+V.
